		 <p><b>Traveling</b>...</br> What is on your mind, when you hear this word?</p>
		 <P>New experiences, feeling of happiness, an opportunity to leave behind all our everyday worries...</P>
		 <p> Travel - on one side causes only positive emotions, but on the other so sad... So many people were deprived of that important and indispensable opportunity, and so did I.</p>
		 <p>This 2020 year have changed a lot of plans in our life, so many journeys were cancelled, so many places left unvisited. That’s why I want to make a journey through my memories.

		 <P>The place where you forget about the time. Where so little things
			become important. Traveling... What is on your mind, when you hear
			this word?</P>
			<p>New experiences, feeling of happiness, an opportunity to leave behind
			all our everyday worries...</p>
			<p>Travel - on one side causes only positive emotions, but on the other
			so sad... So many people were deprived of that important and
			indispensable opportunity, and so did I.</p>
			<p>This 2020 year have changed a lot of plans in our life, so many
			journeys were cancelled, so many places left unvisited. That’s why I
			want to make a journey throw my memories
			The place, where you forget about the time. Where so many things
			become unimportant. Where you can breath full lungs while beholding
			the power of Nature.</p>
			<p><b></br>Mountains...</b> </br>Every time I’m there I feel complete.
			Alps are charming, the variety of landscapes and the beauty of nature
			can’t leave anyone indifferent.
			Alps spread all over many European countries, and I was so lucky to
			visit almost all of them.</p>
			<p>I’d like to share my experience of these journeys, with hope that some
			day our life will return back to normal, and I could travel to Alps to
			feel myself free again.</p><br><br>
